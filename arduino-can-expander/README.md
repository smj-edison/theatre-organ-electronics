# Arduino CAN Expander (rev. 4)

This includes all the files necessary to order and assemble the arduino CAN Expander board.

This board adds 8 I2C JST ports, as well as a CAN interface. It can be powered through the MINI-DIN-4
port for low power needs, or with external power for larger loads. It also has 6 analog inputs that can
be connected to various continous sensors (e.g. potentiometer on swell shade). The external power port
can also be used to provide power for external sensors.
